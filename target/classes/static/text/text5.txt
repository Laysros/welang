Mr Bean: - Good morning!

Shopkeeper: - Morning. How’s are you today?

Mr Bean: - Not so bad, thanks, you?

Shopkeeper: - Am good, apart from all this rain! It’s chucking down again!

Mr Bean: - Yes, it’s awful, isn’t it? And it is very cold!

Shopkeeper: - The weather forecast said it will brighten up after lunch.

Mr Bean: - They always say that! Still, I can’t complain it’s a lot warmer than back home.

Shopkeeper: - Really? Where are you from?

Mr Bean: - Am from Russia

 Shopkeeper: - What’s the weather like in Russia now?

Mr Bean: - Freezing cold, and snowing.

Shopkeeper: - Right! So this must be like summer for you!

Mr Bean: - Right! But I do like the snow sometimes.
